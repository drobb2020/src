# Python Django Picture Preview with Bootstrap Modal

This project is based on a [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87Hj55vCVz8) by Pyplane.

In this tutorial I learned how to combine Django and Bootstrap along with ajax and JavaScript to produce an interesting photo popup modal for viewing a larger version of the image.

To duplicate create a virtual environment using the requirements.txt file in this repository.
